# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of Project
This project uses Mapbox to display an animated map showing the stops between MIT and Harvard.
Users can visualize the bus route and follow a simulated movement of a bus along this route.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain a Mapbox API key by signing up at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
3. Add your Mapbox API key to the `mapanimation.js` file in the appropriate place.
4. Ensure you have an active internet connection for loading Mapbox resources.
5. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
6. Click the button to display the stops and animate the bus movement between MIT and Harvard.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Implement real-time tracking of actual bus positions using GPS data.
- Display estimated bus arrival times at each stop based on real-time data.
- Add a search feature to find and display other bus routes.
